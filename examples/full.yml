# This is a sample cyber range definition description for the CyRIS cyber range
# instantiation system. The description is written in YAML format and contains
# three main sections, as follows:
# - host_settings:  Contains information about the hosts the cyber range is to be
#                   deployed on, including an id, a management address, a virtual
#                   bridge address, and a management account.
# - guest_settings: Provides information about the base images. It defines the entire
#                   content of the cyber range that CyRIS needs to prepare.
# - clone_settings: Gives details about the cloning phase. It has a unique range id,
#                   and information about hosts, guests, and network topology.

#########################################################################################
# Start of the host_settings section. For each host, it consists of 4 fields:
#  @param    id           The id of the host.
#  @param    mgmt_addr    The management address used to access the host.
#  @param    virbr_addr   The virtual bridge address that the host uses to communicate
#                         with the virtual machines that will be created on it.
#                         On installation KVM typically creates a default virtual
#                         bridge virbr0 with the default IP address 192.168.122.1.
#  @param    account      The account name on the host that is to be used by CyRIS.
#                         CyRIS accesses the host by SSH public key, which needs to be
#                         prepared in advance by the user.
#
# The number of hosts specified in this section is not limited. In this example,
# it consists of one host with id "host_1".

# Start of the guest_settings section. For each base image, it consists of 7 fields:
# @param    id                    The id of the base image, which by convention reflects
#                                 its role in the cyber range (desktop, web server,
#                                 database, etc.).
# @param    ip_addr               Optional. The IP address of the base image, so that CyRIS can
#                                 access it from the host.
# @param    basevm_host           The host that the base image is located on.
# @param    basevm_config_file    The path to the configuration file of the base image,
#                                 for KVM to be able to define and start it.
# @param    basevm_type           The virtualization type of the base image. Currently
#                                 CyRIS supports KVM and AWS virtualization.
# @param    basevm_os_type        The type of the base image OS (Linux, Windows, etc.).
# @param    tasks                 The definition of all the setup tasks that CyRIS needs
#                                 to do on the base image. Specific parameters needed for
